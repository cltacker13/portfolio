        <div class="content-text"><p>Lifetime Learner, Innovator, and Co-Founder of Yogi-Go Fitness </p>
            <p>I have had the pleasure of exploring a variety of career opportunities, 
                including veterinary medicine and marine biology, art and ancient history, journalism, 
                copywriting and marketing, as well as entrepreneurship as a software as a service mobile application.
                But the one thing every role has in common: my passion to learn and create innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>Each step of my journey has taught me to explore new opportunities with wonder, 
                to lean into the difficult tasks to better understand them, 
                and to nuture relations for successful collaboration.</p>
